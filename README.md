# traffic-light-controller
This project simulates a traffic light controller using C.

It uses enums and structs to represent traffic light states and transitions between them.

## Features
- Traffic light state simulation
- Uses enum for clear state representation
- Uses struct for state data
- Demonstrates basic state machine logic

## Purpose
This project was created to learn low-level programming concepts used in embedded systems and automation.
